 * There are two types of polymorphism.
 * * Static (compile-time), Dynamic (runtime).
 * * Static is represented using overloading and templates.
 * * Dynamic polymorphism is represented with inheritance.
 * * Dynamic type causes overhead at runtime.
 * * To solve this overhead we use the CRTP pattern.
